# Predicting Combat Results from Pokémon Characteristics
In this project, we aim to predict the combat results from Pokémon characteristics. Classification methods including logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA), K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Support Vector Machines(SVM), and tree models are used to predict the combat results.
